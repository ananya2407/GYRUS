# GYRUS
Project by team Nyx 


GYRUS is a state of the art breast cancer prediction interface that employs the best machine learning tools available to accurately predict the occurrence of cancer in an individual.Current diagnosis and prediction of a disease by doctors are based on control values used by doctors to assess the condition. Normal ranges used are not always revised to consider the variance of a lot of factors such as age, lifestyle and demographics.

The need of the hour is a technical based prediction system which using historical data can predict the likelihood of cancer in a patient, saving a lot of time and effort diagnosis of the disease. Our website harnesses the power of Machine Learning to predict the status of a tumor, whether it is malignant or benign, based on inputs from a mammogram test of a tumor tissue. This solution simplifies the prediction process for doctors with enhanced accuracy and also eases the work for both patients and doctors.
